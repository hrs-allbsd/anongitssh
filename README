and then do "make && make install".  "anongitssh" will be
installed into /usr/local/libexec as a setuid binary.

* Configuration

Add a user whose name is ANONGIT_USER and the shell is
/usr/local/libexec/anongitssh.  The home directory has to exist
and it has to be able to read the directory REPODIR_PREFIX.
Do not forget to add /usr/local/libexec/anongitssh into /etc/shells.

Repositories must be under REPODIR_PREFIX.  The following command line
on the client will attempt to read a repository at "REPODIR_PREFIX/src.git":

% git clone anongit@repo.allbsd.org:src.git

Note that the following 5 characters in the repository name will be removed:
